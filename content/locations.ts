    introParagraphs: [
      "Denver is a city of active renovation and older housing stock. Many neighborhoods have homes built from the early 1900s through the mid-century, and full gut renovations are a regular part of life in Capitol Hill, Baker, Wash Park, Five Points, Highlands, Sunnyside, Berkeley, and Park Hill. Whether you are updating a century-old craftsman, clearing an estate, or gutting a duplex kitchen, a roll off dumpster rental is one of the most practical ways to manage the volume of debris that comes out of an older Denver home without making thirty trips to the landfill.",
      'Infill development and active construction around RiNo, LoDo, Cherry Creek, and downtown Denver continue to drive demand for construction-grade containers. Smaller lot sizes and urban density in many Denver neighborhoods mean dumpsters often need to go in a driveway, down an alley, or in a designated area — not the wide open suburban front yard that a lot of rental guides assume. Planning where the container lands before it arrives makes the whole rental go smoother.',
      'The broader Denver metro — Lakewood, Aurora, Arvada, Wheat Ridge, Englewood, Littleton, Westminster, Thornton, and Commerce City — sees steady dumpster rental demand from suburban cleanouts, residential remodels, roofing jobs, and rental property turnovers. Rolloff Dumpster Finder helps connect Denver-area customers with roll off dumpster rental options sized for the project at hand, not just the next size up.',

        question: 'How much does a dumpster rental cost in Denver?',
        answer:
          'Dumpster rental prices in Denver vary based on container size, debris type, weight, rental period, and delivery location. A 10-yard container typically runs $280–$480 per week. A 20-yard runs $380–$650. A 30-yard ranges from $450–$780. These are general estimates — your actual quote will depend on your project specifics and provider availability.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What size dumpster do I need for a home cleanout in Denver?',
        answer:
          'For a full-home cleanout in Denver, most homeowners find a 20-yard dumpster handles the job comfortably. For a garage-only or single-room cleanout, a 10-yard may be enough. For larger estate cleanouts or homes with heavy accumulated debris, a 30-yard gives you more room without needing a second haul.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I put a dumpster on the street in Denver?',
        answer:
          'Street placement in Denver may require a permit from the City and County of Denver. If your driveway or alley can accommodate the container, that is typically the simpler option. Check with your rental provider and the Denver Department of Public Works before placing a container in a public right-of-way.',

      {
        question: 'What dumpster size is best for a roofing project in Denver?',
        answer:
          'A 20-yard dumpster handles most residential roofing tear-offs in Denver. Shingles are heavy — most 20-yard containers have a weight limit of 2–4 tons, and a full roof tear-off can approach or exceed that depending on roof size and material. Confirm the weight limit with your provider before booking a roofing container.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I rent a dumpster for concrete, dirt, or brick in Denver?',
        answer:
          'Yes, but heavy debris like concrete, soil, brick, and asphalt typically requires a dedicated heavy-material container with appropriate weight allowances. Standard roll off dumpsters have weight limits that dense materials hit quickly. Let your provider know upfront what you are hauling so they can quote the right container.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How long can I keep a dumpster rental in Denver?',
        answer:
          'Standard dumpster rental periods are typically 7–10 days. Extensions are available at a daily rate. If you know your project will run longer, ask about extended rental pricing upfront — it is often more cost-effective to book a longer window from the start than to extend mid-rental.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do dumpster rental prices in Denver include disposal fees?',
        answer:
          'Most flat-rate dumpster rental quotes include delivery, the rental period, pickup, and disposal up to the stated weight limit. If your load exceeds the weight limit, you may be charged an overweight fee — typically $40–$200 per extra ton. Always confirm what is included before you confirm the booking.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Are there items I cannot throw in a Denver dumpster?',
        answer:
          'Yes. Paint, chemicals, motor oil, propane tanks, batteries, tires, appliances with refrigerants, asbestos, and hazardous waste are not accepted in standard roll off dumpsters. Electronics restrictions vary by provider. Check with your rental company if you have items you are unsure about.',

Availability and pricing may vary by specific delivery location.',

        question: 'How soon can I get a roll off dumpster delivered in Denver?',
        answer:
          'Delivery availability depends on the provider and current demand. Same-week delivery is often possible, and some providers may offer next-day options depending on availability. For planned projects, booking a few days in advance gives you more flexibility on delivery timing.',
